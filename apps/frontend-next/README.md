# Frontend (Next.js) Placeholder

This folder will host the Next.js app with role-based areas for Admin, Accountant, Student, Teacher, and Parent. Use create-next-app or a custom template.

Suggested next steps
- `pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest` and select TypeScript.
- Configure auth with HTTP-only cookies and route guards per role.
- Set up API clients in `packages/sdk-clients`.
